YADTK is an open-source toolkit to develop rule-based spoken dialogue systems.

Its documentation is available at http://www-lium.univ-lemans.fr/~lehuen/yadtk/

Here are the main scripts you will need to use:

- The script install-macos.bash installs YADTK on MacOS platforms. It not
  requires any Internet connection.

- The script install-ubuntu.bash installs YADTK on Ubuntu platforms. It requires
  an Internet connection. You can configure a proxy at the beginning of the script.

- The script newapp.bash <application> allows you to create a new application.
  It creates data folders that contains a new basic knowledge. Use this script
  only if you want to create a new application.

- The script compiler.bash <application> compiles and deploys an existing
  knowledge into the target data folders. You must launch this script at least
  once and after any change on a knowledge file.

- The script run.bash configurations.xml <ident> launches the YADTK
  configuration which is identified by <ident> in the configuration file.
  You can edit this file in order to specify your own configurations.

- The script graphmaker.bash <application> [<concept>] [<depth>] builds a
  graphical representation of a YASPML knowledge, using the Graphviz toolkit.
